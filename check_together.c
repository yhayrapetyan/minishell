// I have to remove READLINE_LIB = -lreadline in makefile, cause it was not working in it.
// And what is in utils.h // # include <readline/readline.h>

// Ask Yura if he is ++ the level of SHLVL

// Ask Yura about how he handles descriptors ? If they are opening in APPEND or REWRITE mod correctly, or it's me who must handle it ?
// Ask also that I always write in STDOUT_FILENO right ?

// Ask Yura if he is using getcwd() for work_dir ?
